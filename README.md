# Katsuniya | Start Small - Create Wonders
As a student in of Computer Science currently enrolled in an A level based school, Computer science amazes me. There are so many things I can do and want to do, but don't have the right skills and resources for. That was my view at the beginning, until I joined Github.

There are so many things that should be worth billions being shared by creative programmers right here. I want to create something people will love not for money or fame, but for the fact that the time I put into that project is being utilized by people.

With that, I would like to ask all fellow developers out there to help me create something unbelievable as a team. That's my main aim for github. If you want to and you're relatively okay with a specific programming language such as python, C#, C++ or a web based language such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Hope we get in touch and create something "Magical" :)
